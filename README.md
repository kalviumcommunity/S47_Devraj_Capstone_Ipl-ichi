# S47_Devraj_Capstone_Ipl-ichi

## Idea brief
- My project is inspired by my hobbies, which are watching IPL and playing cricket. I also like to cook. The basic project idea is to build a website that will have a list of all the IPL(Indian Premier League) matches list. Users can select a match and can book the tickets for it. Also when he opens the match from the list he will get two options if he is watching the match from home or from the stadium if he is watching the from home then he will get local food suggestions to order food so that he can get the home like experience at home like if the match is happening at Lucknow so he will be given suggestions that he can order kebabs from the famous places of Lucknow. And if a user is watching the match from the stadium he can order the local food to the stadium only. Users can also log in and sign up with Google. Users can also share their feedback and experience with the app.

## Plan of Action
1. On the first day, I will Collect all the data for the API.
2. On the second day, I will collect the data and also start the work for the front end.
3. I will try to finalize all the front end and make JSON data for the API.
